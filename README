compiler testsuite
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is a little compiler-testsuite, currently mostly useful for
use with cc65 and the c64, but generic and portable enough to be
used on other targets....

a lot of the test programs are nicked from other sources. please notice some
tests are released under a different licence which is stated in each test, the
respective licence text is available in the docs directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"maketests" is a shell script to serve as a frontend for running automated
tests on both a reference- and a target compiler, and making a report in
html.

before being able to use the script, make sure the definitions in the file
arch/<target>/makefile.<targetcc> meet your current setup.

if you are using the "run6502" target (which is default), then also make sure
that you update the run6502.lib runtime on each compiler update.

use "maketests --clean --all" to run the entire testsuite, "maketests --help"
gives you a list of available commandline options.

needed external tools:

- sed, grep, make
- c2html
- ca65html (from the cc65 package)

adding more tests
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

please look at example.c in the tests directory, use that as a template.

you may just put your additional tests into the tests directory, or place them
anywhere else and call the script like this:

"maketests --add-dir /my/stuff/" (adds all files in the directory to the list
of tests) or

"maketests --skip-default --add-test /my/stuff/weird.c" (skips the tests in the
default tests directory, and adds one test)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cc65/c64 related notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

needed tools:
    x64, cc65, c1541 (from the vice package), cbmcvt (from the cc65 package)

- if a test will hang, because the binaries dont exit
cleanly to basic, reset the emu and load/run the file in question
manually.

- the "yacc" test appearently seems to hang atm (reset and load next test)
